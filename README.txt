README Subtiligase-TM supplementary scripts. 

List of scripts.

abu_silac.py. Script for SILAC data analysis and statistical testing from a Skyline report. 

adjustpepXML.py. Script for adjusting Protein Prospector output to match the mass modification that Skyline expect for N-terminal alpha-aminobutyric acid. 

membrane_type.py. Script for annotating membrane protein types of proteins identified in subtiligase N terminomics datasets. 

subcellularlocation.py. Script for annotating subcellular locations of proteins identified in subtiligase N terminomics datasets. 

topo_dom.py. Script for annotating the topological domains from which N-terminal peptides identified in subtiligase N terminomics experiments are derived. 

transmembranedistances.py. Script for calculating the distance between subtiligase-capture N termini and transmembrane domains. 

Supplementary file.

uniprot-human-2017.txt. A Uniprot flat file that can be used to run these scripts. 

Notes. 

Python scripts were run using Python 2.7 (www.python.org). All scripts include descriptive comments (marked by #) and headers with detailed instructions.

Instructions for running scripts. These scripts are run from the command line by typing, for example, ‘python Script1.py argument1 argument2’. Information on files needed to run the script, arguments required, and outputs generated are given in the script header.
